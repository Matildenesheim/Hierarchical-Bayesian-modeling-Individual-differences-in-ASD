MSc. Cognitive Science Thesis. 

The  thesis aims to explore whether the underlying associative- or attentional mechanisms can explain individual differences in learning associated with autistic traits. 
To do so, a simplified and ALCOVE-inspired formal model of learning was constructed with the aim of inferring the actual course of learning in four experiments.  

Two attentional learning paradigms (blocking, highlighting) were explored with and without social information to probe for the latent cognitive processes involved in learning associated with autistic traits in both social and non-social contexts - resulting in four experiments. 

The simplified ALCOVE-inspired model was employed in hierarchical linear regression models to infer potential individual differences in underlying cognitive processes in each experiment.

In addition to exploring whether individual differences in learning could be explained by latent associative- or attentional mechanisms, the relationship between response noise and autistic traits was investigated in all models. This was done to explore whether increased autistic traits would yield atypical response patterns or simply noisier data.


The hierarchical models were applied using JAGS through the R2Jags package, and the architecture of the hierarchical model with the learning model employed can be seen in the txt.
